KWE is a content management system written in PHP and based on the KWF framework.

There is no documentation right now, besides from comments in the code. Hopefully I will try to write some soon.

The server needs PHP version 5.3 or newer. If you want nice URL:s you will have to enable mod_rewrite in Apache.

I'm sorry for a lot of Swedish sentences and words in the code, I haven't figured out how to handle multiple languages in the framework yet.
